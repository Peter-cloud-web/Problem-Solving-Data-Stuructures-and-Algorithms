    /**
     *
     * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
     *
     * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
     *
     * You can return the answer in any order.
     *
     *
     * SOLUTION PSEUDOCODE
     *
     * Use a nested loop
     * Check if the sum of two integers equals to the target
     * Get the index of the two values and insert them into an array
     * return the array
